	movl %esi, (%rdi,%rax,4) moves from register to memory location(%rdi)
	moq 24(%rdi,) from memory to array


	Practice Problem 3.41
	A) Offsets size of field
	p 0	   8
	s.x 8	   4
	s.y 12	   4
	next 16	   8

	24 Total bytes needed for structure

	B)

	C)
	movl 12(%rdi), %eax		int x = eax
	movl %eax, 8(%rdi)		
	leaq 8(%rdi), %rax		Grabs address of x and places in rax
	movq %rax,(%rdi)	       grabs address and places it in p sp->p
	movq %rdi,16(%rdi)	       spC -> next = sp rdi changes memory 	
	ret				return;

	for the double since it occupies a byte it has to be a multiple of 8

	calculate what is the k that the whole structure hsa to have
	the largest k in all of its fields

	primitive data type require k bytes

	after c add 3 bytes of nothing so p+4 can be added in

	24 is a multiple of 8


	i[0] starts at p+8, i[1] p+ 16
	cannot alter the order fo  the beelxsyes
	xsxcxxs

	3.44 Practice Problem
	A struct P1(int caim an ea%aaaaaaaw

a	0 8
	c 4	4
	struct
	if nothing it means no desciriton
	4 -> 16xs

	b. struct P2
	offset size of struct alignment req
	0      	       	      4

double 8
long 8
short 2
float 4

idx = %rdi

    Advice try to paly the larger fields first and then the smallest at the end
    That is a better way of using the space
